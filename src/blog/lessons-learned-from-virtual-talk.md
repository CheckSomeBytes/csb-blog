I share insights gained from presenting at BSides Idaho, a virtual infosec conference, after having to abandon plans for an in-person event due to COVID-19. My talk, "Suspect Last Seen Wearing Admin Creds," is available on YouTube.

## Lesson 1: Humor Doesn't Translate Well Virtually

I discovered that comedy falls flat in virtual presentations. When attempting to point out ridiculous clip art (specifically a character I called the "World's Happiest Robber"), the joke fell FLAT because streaming platforms lack real-time voice chat feedback.

**Recommendation:** Rather than explicitly highlighting humorous elements, let the material speak for itself and integrate any attempted humor subtly into your core message.

## Lesson 2: Have Backup Plans

My power failed just five minutes into the talk, forcing a three-minute recovery period while my desktop rebooted.

**Recommendation:** Maintain a primary streaming setup but prepare a hotspot-connected laptop ready for the switch over in a matter of seconds rather than minutes.

## Lesson 3: Submit Early, Perfect Later

The most impactful lesson involved overcoming perfectionism. I had delayed submission for a year, assuming conference judges expected polished final presentations. After receiving encouragement to submit an abstract, I applied to BSides Idaho and worked collaboratively with organizers to develop the final presentation around a structured framework.

**Encouragement:** Don't let incomplete ideas prevent pursuing projects. Submit talks or start projects without requiring absolute completion first.

This review covers the SANS SEC542 course on Web Application Penetration Testing and its corresponding GIAC Web Application Penetration Tester (GWAPT) certification. As primarily a defensive security professional, I evaluate the course's effectiveness for building foundational red-team skills.

## Course Structure

The curriculum follows the "Learn → Break → Automate" methodology: understanding legitimate functionality, manually exploiting it, then automating attacks with tools. The content aligns with OWASP Top 10 and the OWASP Testing Guide.

## Daily Breakdown

- **Day 1:** Information gathering and DNS reconnaissance
- **Day 2:** Configuration, identity, and authentication testing
- **Day 3:** Session management, command injection, SQL injection
- **Day 4:** XXE and XSS vulnerabilities
- **Day 5:** CSRF, logic flaws, and penetration testing business practices
- **Day 6:** Team-based Capture the Flag competition

## Main Takeaway

Most web-based attack vectors are concentrated on a few core concepts. The course emphasizes documentation's importance throughout the penetration testing process.

## Recommended For

- Aspiring penetration testers
- Defenders seeking attacker perspective
- Developers wanting to understand security implications of insecure code

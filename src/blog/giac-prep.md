This guide presents a systematic approach to preparing for GIAC (Global Information Assurance Certification) exams, which are open-book tests allowing candidates to bring printed materials to the testing center.

## Key Preparation Strategy

Having access to course materials during the exam doesn't eliminate the need for preparation. The method focuses on two main outputs: a reference binder and tabbed course books.

## Book Tabbing System

The tabbing approach uses two levels:

### Major Tabs

Divide books into 6-8 main sections, typically following the course structure.

### Minor Tabs

Flag important concepts within those sections, ideally color-coded to match their major category.

This system provides several benefits:

- Quickly identify which books contain specific topics
- Dramatically reduces lookup time during the exam

## Reference Binder Creation

Create condensed notes in your own words from course content. This time-intensive process strengthens understanding and identifies knowledge gaps. Maintain consistent formatting across similar topics, enabling faster retrieval during testing.

## Exam Strategy

When sitting for the certification, use this prioritized approach:

1. **Answer from memory** if confident
2. **Consult the reference binder** (15-second limit)
3. **Use tabbed books** (30-second limit)
4. **Skip difficult questions** for later review

While not the quickest preparation path, this method produces "great reference material that you can use on the job."

As an Elastic employee who recently passed the Elastic Certified Engineer (ECE) exam, I provide a comprehensive review of the certification, its structure, and preparation strategies.

## Key Takeaway

The exam itself was a fair assessment of the candidate's knowledge around engineering an Elasticsearch cluster. Tasks reflect real-world scenarios engineers encounter daily.

## Intended Audience

**Suitable for:**

- Individuals wanting to learn about building and maintaining an Elastic stack
- Security/data analysts interested in transitioning to engineering or data science roles

**Not suitable for:**

- Those seeking to improve Kibana search and visualization skills (a separate Analyst certification exists)

## Exam Structure

The ECE is entirely hands-on and task-oriented with no multiple-choice questions. Candidates work in a Linux VM environment with access to Elasticsearch clusters, completing configuration and data interaction tasks via developer tools.

### Key Design Features

**Documentation Access:** Candidates can reference official Elasticsearch documentation, eliminating memorization pressure and creating realistic working conditions.

**Business-Style Requirements:** Tasks are phrased as business objectives requiring specific solutions, emphasizing practical problem-solving over rote knowledge.

## Preparation Resources

### Free Resources

- YouTube preparation video with example questions
- Official exam topic list checklist

### Official Training

- Elastic Engineer I & II courses ($1,600 each)
- Instructor-led training provides slides, labs, and expert access

### Self-Study Alternatives

- Medium blog exercises by Guido Lenacota
- A Cloud Guru's Elastic certification course

## Pro Tips

1. **Collapse JSON sections** to verify nesting and reduce cognitive overload
2. **Develop bracket-hunting skills** to troubleshoot JSON structure errors
3. **Verify implementations** using the Cat API to confirm configurations took effect

Hands-on Dev-Tools experience is the most crucial preparation factor.
